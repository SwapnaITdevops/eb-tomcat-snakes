The error message ERROR: Unable to find Jenkinsfile from git https://github.com/aws-samples/eb-tomcat-snakes.git indicates that Jenkins is unable to locate the Jenkinsfile in the specified Git repository. For Jenkins to execute a pipeline, it needs to find a Jenkinsfile in the root directory of the repository, unless a different path is specified.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Verify Jenkinsfile Exists:

Ensure that a Jenkinsfile is present in the root directory of the repository https://github.com/aws-samples/eb-tomcat-snakes.git.
If the Jenkinsfile is located in a subdirectory, specify the path to the Jenkinsfile in your pipeline configuration.
Pipeline Script from SCM Configuration:

If you are using the "Pipeline script from SCM" option in Jenkins, make sure the repository URL and branch are correctly specified.
Ensure that the Script Path is set correctly if your Jenkinsfile is not in the root directory.
Example of Using a Jenkinsfile in the Root Directory
If your Jenkinsfile is in the root directory, make sure your pipeline configuration looks like this:

Configure the Pipeline Job:
Go to your Jenkins job configuration.
Select "Pipeline" as the project type.
In the "Pipeline" section, choose "Pipeline script from SCM".
Select "Git" as the SCM.
Enter the repository URL: https://github.com/aws-samples/eb-tomcat-snakes.git.
Leave the "Script Path" as Jenkinsfile if it is in the root directory.
Example of Using a Jenkinsfile in a Subdirectory
If your Jenkinsfile is in a subdirectory, specify the relative path to the Jenkinsfile:

Configure the Pipeline Job:
Go to your Jenkins job configuration.
Select "Pipeline" as the project type.
In the "Pipeline" section, choose "Pipeline script from SCM".
Select "Git" as the SCM.
Enter the repository URL: https://github.com/aws-samples/eb-tomcat-snakes.git.
Set the "Script Path" to the relative path of the Jenkinsfile, for example, subdirectory/Jenkinsfile.
Using Pipeline Script Directly
Alternatively, you can directly paste the pipeline script into Jenkins:

Configure the Pipeline Job:
Go to your Jenkins job configuration.
Select "Pipeline" as the project type.
In the "Pipeline" section, choose "Pipeline script".
Paste your pipeline script into the provided text area.
Hereâ€™s the corrected pipeline script for direct input:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        PATH = "/opt/maven/bin:$PATH"
    }
    stages {
        stage('print') {
            steps {
                echo "Hello World"
            }
        }
        stage('clone') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/aws-samples/eb-tomcat-snakes.git'
            }
        }
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean install"
            }
        }
    }
}
